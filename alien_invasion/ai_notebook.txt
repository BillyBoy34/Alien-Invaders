Here I am going to type everything that I am learning about this project.

In a game project, the first thing you need to do is create a background or a surface.
That surface also needs to be able to get input.

First you initialize the settings for the background, you initialize everything that
you need and then you start the main loop where things actually happen.

A smart thing to do is to make a separate setting file in which to edit.
